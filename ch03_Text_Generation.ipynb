Here’s a simple recipe to guide you through the process.\\n\\n### Ingredients\\n\\n#### For the Dough:\\n- 2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)\\n- 1 teaspoon sugar\\n- ¾ cup warm water (about 110°F or 43°C)\\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour (plus extra for dusting)\\n- 1 teaspoon salt\\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\\n\\n#### For the Toppings:\\n- 1 cup pizza sauce (store-bought or homemade)\\n- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese\\n- Toppings of your choice (pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, olives, etc.)\\n- Dried oregano or basil (optional)\\n- Olive oil (for brushing)\\n\\n### Instructions\\n\\n#### Step 1: Prepare the Dough\\n1. **Activate Yeast**: In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.\\n   \\n2. **Mix Dough**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until the dough begins to come together.\\n\\n3. **Knead**: Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it’s smooth and elastic. Add a little more flour if the dough is too sticky.\\n\\n4. **First Rise**: Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.\\n\\n#### Step 2: Prepare the Pizza\\n1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) and place a pizza stone or baking sheet inside to heat.\\n\\n2. **Shape Dough**: Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Transfer it to a floured surface and roll it out to your desired thickness (usually about 12 inches for a standard pizza).\\n\\n3. **Transfer Dough**: If using a pizza stone, transfer the rolled-out dough onto a piece of parchment paper. If using a baking sheet, just place it on the greased sheet.\\n\\n4. **Add Sauce and Toppings**: Spread a layer of pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top and add your desired toppings.\\n\\n5. **Optional Seasoning**: Sprinkle with dried oregano or basil for extra flavor.\\n\\n6. **Brush with Olive Oil**: Lightly brush the edges of the crust with olive oil for a golden finish.\\n\\n#### Step 3: Bake the Pizza\\n1. **Bake**: Carefully slide the pizza (or parchment paper) onto the hot pizza stone or place the baking sheet in the oven. Bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling.\\n\\n2. **Cool & Slice**: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Slice it into wedges and serve hot.\\n\\n### Enjoy!\\nPizza is customizable, so feel free to experiment with different sauces, cheeses, and toppings to suit your tastes.
